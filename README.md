#### Evaluation Criteria
The evaluation metric will be the mean of the weighted avg. of the recall score generated for both the y-variables 

score1 = 100 x recall\_score(actual\_values['payment\_code'], predicted\_values['payment\_code'], average ='weighted')  
score2 = 100 x recall\_score(actual\_values['coupon\_code'], predicted\_values['coupon\_code'], average ='weighted')  
score = (score1+score2)/2
